8/30/2011;BdD7fsPqHQL73hwENEDT-Q;c_-hF15XgNhlyy_TqzmdaA;The only place inside the Loop that you can stay for $55/night. Also, the only place you can have a picnic dinner and get a little frisky on the 17th floor roof and then wake up in your room the next morning to an army of ants going in on your picnic leftovers.;3;0;3;4;N;tQfLGoolUMu2J0igcWcoZg

6/3/2012;kgVxanwQ0fbPKOq-o6b9GA;ARDNgwRWVUmBOm5bzvi-KA;Pros: fantastic location at a good price, stately building, big comfortable bed Cons: slightly smelly room, horrible hot water pressure, no on-command movie TV system, front desk usually unoccupied Overall: would use again, but first would try other comparably-priced hotels in same neighborhood.;3;0;0;0;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
2/17/2011;W6iFBr;JyqDfAiDbtASahLea4NFjA;Traveling on a budget is what brought me here. If I was not I would have been at the Sofitel or the Grad Hyatt. Location, location, location is the draw here. Located near North Michigan, and Rush is very convenient. Initially we had a queen and requested to upgrade to a Kind facing the front. They did this without any extra charge. Kudos to the staff for being accommodating. I have to warn you though, the carpet mixed with the burning candles they have throughout the lobby was nauseating to me. The carpet needs to be changed in the lobby as well as in the elevator. The floor and the rooms were fine thought, Thank God! This hotel has so much potential to redeem it's old world charm, but it seems like money may be tight.;2;0;0;0;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
10/25/2010;x4FHvju16JpVa3ihzIwQvw;IhKctrZ3BtJkfpf0qO-8mQ;My husband and I came to Chicago for a week and decided to stay here. The price was right and it's in a very convenient neighborhood. Yes, it's old and small but we had a good time here. We stayed in a room with one queen bed and it was more spacious than I thought it would be. You could tell one wall had some water damage at one time, but everything was clean and everything worked. I didn't deal with the staff besides checking in and out, but the people I did speak with were friendly. There weren't a ton of amenities but I didn't come to Chicago to hang out in my hotel room. The train is only a few blocks away and you're surrounded by tons of places to go shopping. I would definitely stay here again.;4;1;0;0;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
10/26/2009;w;rIhwHyWLy4iyXOaqyqjJsw;My mom stayed here 4 or 5 years ago and loved its quaint charm, so when she met me in Chicago at the tail end of a business trip, we were excited to find that Hotwire had placed us here. Things have apparently changed. No room service, no vending or ice machines on the floors and no in-room coffee. The room was clean but a bit beyond "charming" in terms of falling apart. The blinds were broken in the bedroom and there weren't any in the bathroom, so you got to pee and shower in full view of the church below and the adjacent corner of hotel rooms. The water didn't drain out of the tub, so by the time I finished a quick shower, I was already shin-deep in water. SICK. The elevators were terrifying. I am all for old, quaint, authentic and charming but this place has really let itself go. Get me some coffee in my god-damned room and some ice machines so I can keep my champagne cold and I'll stop bitching. Promise.;3;2;1;1;N;33Xc1Bk_gkSY5xb2doQ7Ng
